# paint-application
A Win32 app made in C++ from scratch. This program offers a drawing feature with colors and much more!
This app can be used to draw on the inbuilt canvas in the app.
It has controls specially made for touch typists, where their left hand is placed on the `a s d f` keys and their right hand is placed on the mouse for drawing.
To avoid confusion, this app also comes with an instructions dialog, which can be accessed through the top menubar.
